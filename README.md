Our dear sweet Mr Streamer's precious naptime is constantly interrupted by the cacophonous din of our collective cries of, "WHY RIMRIM NOT WORK???"
No longer, I say!
The day has come to save our own arses, by deleting all of our saves, mods, and configs in one glorious fell swoop!
Join me in perfect Rim-nesia and find yourself at peace such that you have never known, so we can all leave Mr Streamer alone.
Back to the content mines with you, chop chop!
(Please tell me if this thing doesn't do what it's supposed to. I am an idiot and have no idea what I'm doing.)
